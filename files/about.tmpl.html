<h3>about</h3>

<p>
This is a fork of the excelent <a target="_blank" href="https://vore.website/">vore.website</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/biox/vore">source</a>) RSS feed reader. You can find the source code for <i>mire</i> on <a target="_blank" href="https://codeberg.org/meadowingc/mire">Codeberg</a>. Any contributions are welcome!

<i>mire</i> aims to be a minimalistic RSS reader in the same vein as vore, but with slightly more features. I originally created the fork because I wanted something exactly like vore but with the ability to know if I had already read an article, as well as maybe also having the ability to get notifications when new articles are posted. I opted for forking the project instead of contributing the changes back to the main project because I saw it was part of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/biox/vore/blob/main/readme">vore's design</a> not to have these features in the first place.

<i>mire</i> is mainly maintained by me, <a target="_blank" href="https://meadow.bearblog.dev/">meadow</a>. If you want to get in contact with me then you can send me an email at <code>`meadowingc ðŸ¦† gmail ðŸ”® com`</code>.

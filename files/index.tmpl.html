intro:

mire.meadowing.club is a minimal, no-bullshit web-based rss/atom feed reader.

mire.meadowing.club is free for anyone to use, and will never be turned into a vehicle for profit.

mire.meadowing.club is a love letter to the rss world - long live syndication!!!


history:

      2020: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/jrss">jrss</a> is born
jrss had one concept: define list of feeds, and jrss will keep that list up to date and display it to you via the web.

      2021: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh">j3s.sh</a> consumes jrss
my main website eventually consumed jrss because it was easier to maintain.

      2023: <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/vore">vore</a>
vore takes the simple foundation from j3s.sh and exposes it as a hosted service for anyone to use!
rss lovers rejoice.


love,
